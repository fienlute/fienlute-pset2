1. First I made the homepage. I had to insert the image, the explanation and the start button. I used two views to get the constrains right for the rotation of the user interface. Then I linked the 'get started' button to the second view controller. 
2. On the second view controller I made a textfield for user input. In this field the user sees what kind of word they have to put in. Above this field, the user can see how many words there are remaining to put in. If the user has put in all the placeholders in the text, they have to click on the "view my story button" to see their story. 
3. On the third view controller the user can see his/her story with their filled in placeholders. If the user clicks on the "make another story" button, all the filled in placeholders will be cleaned for a new user and he/she is redirected to the home page of the app.
